_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add a professional footer section to the admin page with "All rights reserved RJW Tech DZ". Let me first examine the admin page structure to understand how to implement this. Let me read more of the file to understand the complete structure and find where to add the footer: Let me read the main return statement of the Admin component to see the complete structure: Let me read around the main return statement of the Admin component: Let me find the end of the main return statement to see where to add the footer: Let me read the very end of the file to see the closing structure: Let me search for the closing structure of the main Admin component return statement: Perfect! Now I can see the structure. The main Admin component ends with a closing `</div>` and `);`. I need to add the footer section before the closing `</div>` of the main container. Let me add a professional footer with "All rights reserved RJW Tech DZ": 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added a professional footer section to the admin page. The footer includes:

1. **Professional Design**: A clean gradient background with proper spacing and typography
2. **Brand Identity**: Features a circular logo with the "R" initial and "RJW Tech DZ" branding
3. **Copyright Notice**: Dynamic year with "All rights reserved RJW Tech DZ" 
4. **Professional Tagline**: "Professional e-commerce solutions & technology services"
5. **Responsive Layout**: Uses Tailwind CSS classes for proper mobile and desktop display
6. **Consistent Styling**: Matches the existing design language of the admin panel

The footer will appear at the bottom of the admin page with a sophisticated design that includes:
- A gradient background from gray-50 to gray-100
- A top border to separate it from the main content
- Centered content with proper spacing
- A circular logo with "R" for RJW Tech DZ
- Dynamic copyright year that updates automatically
- Professional styling that maintains the page's overall aesthetic

The footer is now ready and will display "© 2025 RJW Tech DZ. All rights reserved." along with the professional tagline.

Let me find the featured images section in the homepage and update it with 6 running shoes images from Unsplash. Now let me read the `featuredCarouselImages` array to see its current structure: Perfect! Now I'll replace the existing images with 6 running shoes images from Unsplash. I'll use properly cropped and fitted URLs: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the featured images section of the homepage with 6 running shoes images from Unsplash. Here's what I changed:

1. **Replaced all existing images** with 6 new running shoes images from Unsplash
2. **Properly cropped and fitted** each image using the URL parameters:
   - `w=1200` for consistent width
   - `h=600` for consistent height (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - `fit=crop` to ensure proper cropping
   - `q=80` for good quality

The new images include:
- White running shoes
- Black Nike shoes
- Red running shoes
- Blue athletic shoes
- Colorful running shoes
- Modern sneakers

All images are now properly formatted with consistent dimensions and will display beautifully in the featured carousel section of the homepage.
